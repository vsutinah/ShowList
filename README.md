This is a web app developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. I developed this app as a side project and its main purpose is to allow users to recommend TV shows, books or anything else to other people.

I am currently finishing some of the remaining features that I aim to put into the very first version of this app, and I will be planning to deploy the app with AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku.

## Getting Started

If you wish to run this app locally, please follow the steps below to get started.

### Installation

```
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the app.

### Initialization

```
npm run dev
```

This is a 'concurrently' script that will run both the server and client side with 'npm run server' & 'npm run client'.
